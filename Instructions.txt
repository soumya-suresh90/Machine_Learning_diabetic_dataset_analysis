Use case
========
Build predictive model.
	Use given training data set and build multiple models (Logistic, Knn and Decision Tree) and choose a better model to predict if the petient is diabetic or not.

 
perform any necessory actions/Analysis to build a model but below techniques to be applied while building model.

-	Use SimpleImputer to fill null values
-	Use RandomSearch CV for hyperparameter tuning
-	Check IF YOU CAN select best features using PCA and can improve accuracy.
-	F1 score for all 3 models.
-	Plot roc curve and choose best model among Logistic Regression, Knn and Decision tree.
-	Every cell in your notebook should have explaination about what you are trying to achieve in that perticular cell.
- 	Your conclusion based on your analysis.
